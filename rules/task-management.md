# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Execution Entry Gate (Required)

- This execution workflow may start only from:
  - `begin task <task-id> in <prd-key>`
  - `begin one-shot in <prd-id>`
  - `begin 1 shot in <prd-id>` (alias of one-shot mode)
- If those commands were not provided, do not implement code or run task execution flow.

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y".
  - Exception: when task mode is explicitly `begin one-shot in <prd-id>`, proceed automatically to the next sub-task after completing the current one.
- **Temporary plan doc workflow:**
  1. For each sub-task, create a temporary plan document in `tasks/tmp/`.
  2. Name the file `plan-task-<task-id>.md` (example: `plan-task-0.3.md`).
  3. Implement the sub-task based on the plan doc.
  4. Run a review and provide the plan doc + task list to the reviewer using `/review`.
  5. After review completion, delete the temporary plan file and only then mark the sub-task complete.
- **Completion protocol:**
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub-task and wait for the user's go-ahead.
  - Exception: when task mode is explicitly `begin one-shot in <prd-id>`, do not pause between sub-tasks.

## Cleanup Phase (Required)

When the final remaining checkbox in `tasks/tasks-prd-<prd-ref>.md` is marked `[x]`, run archive cleanup immediately.

Archive target:

- `tasks/archive/<prd-ref>/`

Files to move:

- `tasks/tasks-prd-<prd-ref>.md`
- `tasks/prd-<prd-ref>.md`
- `tasks/tdd-<prd-ref>.md`

Rules:

1. Create `tasks/archive/<prd-ref>/` if it does not already exist.
2. Move all three files into that folder after final completion is confirmed.
3. If any required file is missing, stop and ask the user before archiving.
4. Perform cleanup before opening the final task-based PR.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Before beginning the first sub-task on a workstream, create and switch to a dedicated feature branch (if not already on one).
2. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
3. After completing each sub-task, create a dedicated git commit summarizing the work before moving to the next sub-task.
4. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub-task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
5. Add newly discovered tasks.
6. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
7. Before starting work, check which sub-task is next.
8. After implementing a sub-task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
   - Exception: when task mode is explicitly `begin one-shot in <prd-id>`, continue directly to the next sub-task after commit + review completion.
9. When all tasks are complete, archive `tasks-prd`, `prd`, and `tdd` into `tasks/archive/<prd-ref>/` before final PR handoff.
