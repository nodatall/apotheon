# Rule: Generating a Technical Design Document (TDD)

## Goal

Generate an execution-focused TDD that defines **how** to implement an approved PRD without ambiguity.

PRD is product truth (`what/why`). TDD is execution truth (`how`) and must stay aligned with PRD behavior.

## Process

1. **Receive Feature Reference:** The user provides a feature name with an approved PRD context.
2. **Validate Prerequisites (Required):** Confirm `tasks/prd-<feature>.md` exists and is approved for technical handoff.
3. **Load Planning Context (Required):** Read `tasks/socratic-<feature>.md` and `tasks/decision-log-<feature>.md` when available so technical decisions remain consistent with locked outcomes.
4. **Derive Technical Requirements:** Translate PRD outcomes into stable technical requirements with IDs (`TDR-*`).
5. **Resolve Ambiguity:** If technical execution is unclear, ask targeted implementation clarifying questions (interfaces, dependencies, rollout, recovery). Do not change product behavior without explicit reconciliation.
6. **PRD Alignment Gate (Required):** If proposed technical behavior conflicts with PRD intent, stop and reconcile before finalizing TDD.
7. **Generate TDD:** Produce `tasks/tdd-<feature>.md` using the required structure below.
8. **Command Contract Gate (Required):** Include exact run commands and expected outcomes for build/test/verification flows.
9. **Save TDD:** Write finalized output to `/tasks/tdd-<feature>.md`.

## TDD Structure

The TDD must include:

1. **Overview and Scope Alignment**
2. **Architecture and Component Boundaries**
3. **Data Model and Storage Changes**
4. **Interfaces and Contracts** (API/CLI/events)
5. **Technical Requirements** with stable IDs (`TDR-*`)
6. **Command Contract**
   - exact commands
   - expected outcomes
7. **Failure Modes and Rollback**
8. **Observability and Monitoring**
9. **Test Strategy** (unit/integration/e2e)
10. **Rollout Plan and Operational Runbook**
11. **Open Technical Questions** (if any)

## Required Quality Rules

- Every material execution behavior must map to at least one `TDR-*`.
- Command contract must be executable as written (no placeholder commands).
- Failure detection and rollback paths must be explicit for high-impact paths.
- Do not leave core runtime/dependency behavior as implicit assumptions.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tdd-<feature>.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start implementation while creating the TDD
2. Keep TDD aligned to PRD intent; reconcile conflicts before completion
3. Use stable `TDR-*` IDs for technical requirements
4. Ensure command contract and verification paths are concrete enough to run without guessing
5. Generate tasks only after both PRD and TDD are complete
6. Hard stop gate: after TDD/task-plan completion, do not begin coding automatically. Build starts only on `begin task <task-id> in <prd-key>`, `begin one-shot in <prd-id>`, or `begin 1 shot in <prd-id>`.
